# RF4S Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the RF4S application, ensuring 80%+ code coverage and production-ready quality.

## Testing Infrastructure

### Tools & Frameworks
- **Vitest**: Fast unit testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing utilities
- **jsdom**: Browser environment simulation
- **@testing-library/jest-dom**: Additional DOM matchers

### Configuration
- Tests run with `npm run test`
- Coverage reports with `npm run test:coverage`
- Watch mode with `npm run test:watch`

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (60% of test suite)
**Target Files:**
- `src/services/metrics/MetricsCollectionService.ts` ✅
- `src/services/realtime/EnhancedWebSocketManager.ts` ✅
- `src/services/RealtimeDataService.ts` ✅
- `src/services/RF4SIntegrationService.ts`
- `src/services/SystemMonitorService.ts`
- `src/core/EventManager.ts`
- All calculator and utility services

**Coverage Goals:**
- Business logic: 90%+
- Service classes: 85%+
- Utility functions: 95%+

### 2. Component Tests (25% of test suite)
**Target Components:**
- `src/components/monitoring/LiveMetricsDashboard.tsx` ✅
- Critical panel components
- UI interaction components
- Form validation components

**Test Scenarios:**
- Rendering with various props
- User interactions
- State changes
- Event handling
- Error states

### 3. Integration Tests (10% of test suite)
**Target Integrations:**
- Service communication flows
- Event system integration
- WebSocket data flow
- Real-time updates

### 4. E2E Tests (5% of test suite)
**Critical User Flows:**
- Application startup
- RF4S connection establishment
- Real-time monitoring
- Configuration changes

## Test Standards

### Naming Conventions
```typescript
describe('ServiceName', () => {
  describe('methodName()', () => {
    it('should do something when condition', () => {
      // Arrange, Act, Assert
    });
  });
});
```

### Mock Strategy
- Mock external dependencies
- Use factories for test data
- Maintain realistic mock responses
- Centralize mocks in `src/test/mocks/`

### Coverage Thresholds
```typescript
thresholds: {
  global: {
    branches: 80,
    functions: 80,
    lines: 80,
    statements: 80
  }
}
```

## Test Data Management
- Mock factories in `src/test/mocks/serviceMocks.ts`
- Realistic test data that matches production
- Consistent data across test suites

## Continuous Integration
- Tests run on every commit
- Coverage reports generated
- Failing tests block deployment
- Performance regression detection

## Next Steps
1. Complete remaining service tests
2. Add component test coverage
3. Implement integration tests
4. Set up E2E testing framework
5. Configure CI/CD pipeline

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npm test MetricsCollectionService.test.ts
```
